# :hospital: Hospital Management System :health_worker:

Made using C++

A hospital management system that allows you to manage appointments, slots, doctors, patients, patient records, and read from text files to allow for mass changes. This is a commnd line program.

In order to compile and run this project, you need to download the directory (zip folder) and then you can use the makefile to run the program. Running ‘make’ while in the directory, will create an executable file (you may need to chmod +x the file to change the permission in order to execute it).

---
### Running Make to get an executable:
```zsh
$ make
```
or 
```zsh
$ make clean
```
#### Sample output:
